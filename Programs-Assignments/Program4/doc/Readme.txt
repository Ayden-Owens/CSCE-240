So to test my code first you have to enter the district77.txt which opens up the data
folder where I have my text file of my district.
From there you can type basically any question you want because that when the chatbot starts. 
My code should handle it. However, I usually type out "what is the rep's name" 
or "how many children does rep have" to get the some result
in the program itself if you type example in the terminal you should see 
example questions which you can base your formatting for your questions off of. 
But just in case here are a list of test questions

- what is the rep's birthdate
- How many children does the rep have
- name of representative
- what is rep about
- about rep
- where does rep live
- what is the representative's home address
- how do I contact rep
- what the rep's committep

this just a few of the questions you can ask
