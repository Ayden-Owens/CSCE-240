So to test my code first you have to enter the district77.txt which opens up the data
folder where I have my text file of my district.
From there you can type basically any question you want because that when the chatbot starts. 
My code should handle it. However, I usually type out "what is the rep's name" 
or "how many children does rep have" to get the some result
in the program itself if you type example in the terminal you should see 
example questions which you can base your formatting for your questions off of. 
But just in case here are a list of test questions

- what is the rep's birthdate
- How many children does the rep have
- name of representative
- what is rep about
- about rep
- where does rep live
- what is the representative's home address
- how do I contact rep
- what the rep's committep

this just a few of the questions you can ask

In addition to this there shoul be a new file that is created in the chat_session folder 
which you can view and see the all the reponses during that chat session.
Also the csv should updated aswell once you end the chat. You can also see that file in chat_session.
it will be formatted as chat_session file name, user utterances, cpu utterances, and the elasped time.

To get to the part where the user can look at past chat session and get statistics is 
first you have to input the district77.txt. After just type summary or chat bot summary.
Thats when you'll be taken summary method where I ask you to type 1, 2, 3. But I have instructions 
on what each number does when you go there. 

However to further explain them when you type 1 it asks you which file you want the statistics of.
It will simply output the date and time of the session, the number of user utterances, then the number of computer utterances,
and finally the elasped time. All you have to do next is type which file you want 1 starting at the 
very first line.

if you type 2 it will output the entire chat session log of your choice. Just type in which file you want
by typing the session number like in option 1.

if you type 3 it ends the program completely
