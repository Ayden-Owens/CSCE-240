So for the final program I changed it up bit.
The user can type anything in the beginning like a question. However they will get
an error message basically saying to retype or rephrase their statement. So, 
in the beginning it asks the user to just enter in the district number in my case 
it would be 77.

Afterwards it will output "Hi my name is Mandy and I am your chatbot!"
The user can know ask it questions about the district. I still have message
that allows the user to see example questions however below I will write the known
queries the system should know/ what we were test on.

“Quit” or “quit” or just “q”
“Tell me about the representative”
“Where does the rep live”
“How do I contact my rep"
“What committees is my repo on”
“Tell me everything”
“What district do you support for Q/A”

Now to get the part of the program that gets
chat-bot statistics you type just type "summary".
Here it will display to you all the sessions and 
the total number of sessions at the bottom.

The display message should say the following:
Would you like a summary enter 1, showchat summary enter 2, showchat enter 3, or exit enter 4
if you enter 1 it will give you a general summary. If you enter 2 it will ask which
specific session you what a summary of which you just insert the number. Just make it is not 
greater than the actual number or limit.
3 you just enter which chat session you what to print out and it prints.
Press 4 to exit unless you enter in a string.If type some obsure text you or
none of the numbers between 1 and 4 it outputs an error message and exit aswell.
